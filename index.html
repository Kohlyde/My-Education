Professor Lea’s extensive industry experience was invaluable as he taught us about software design patterns, agile methodologies, and project management techniques.</p>
                <p>We learned about various design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Strategy, and their applications in creating robust and maintainable software. Implementing these patterns in real-world projects helped me appreciate their importance in designing scalable and flexible systems.</p>
                <p>We also gained practical experience with agile methodologies, including Scrum and Kanban. Working in teams, we simulated real-world software development environments, from initial requirements gathering to final deployment. This hands-on experience was instrumental in developing my collaborative skills and understanding the importance of effective communication and documentation in software projects.</p>

                <p>Operating Systems and Compiler Construction were two of the most technically demanding courses I took with Professor Lea. In Operating Systems, we studied the inner workings of OS components, including process management, memory allocation, and file systems.</p>
                <p>We wrote parts of an operating system kernel, which was an eye-opening experience. Understanding how the OS manages hardware resources and provides services to applications deepened my appreciation for system-level programming.</p>
                <p>In Compiler Construction, we learned about the principles of translating high-level programming languages into machine code. Building a simple compiler from scratch was one of the most challenging projects, involving lexical analysis, syntax parsing, and code generation. This experience taught me about the complexities of language design and implementation.</p>
